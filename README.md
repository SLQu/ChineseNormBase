# Chinese Socio-cultural Norm Base

Social norms are guiding principles for personal conduct in social interactions, emphasizing respect, cooperation, and appropriate behavior, crucially contributing to healthy relationships, effective communication, and individual social integration. This paper proposes a novel framework for extracting Chinese social-cultural norms and constructs the first publicly accessible Chinese Social-Culture Norm Base (ChineseNormBase). We employ socially-aware dialogues enriched with essential meta-information as the primary data source for our framework. These dialogues are input into a prompt incorporating dialogue content and ontology information. With the prompt, the GPT-3 model is able to generate high-quality social-cultural norms. Additionally, comprehensive experiments have been conducted to showcase the practical utility of our dataset as a supplementary source of knowledge, particularly for dialogues-related tasks. Moreover, we outline how our knowledge base is transformed into a bipartite graph, revealing latent yet significant structural insights.
