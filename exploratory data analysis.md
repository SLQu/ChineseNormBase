# Distribution of Scn Statements on Sociocultural Factors
From Figure 1, in each sub-plot, the vertical axis
quantifies the frequency of each category, while the horizontal axis
represents categories with the three bars corresponding to different
dialogue and frame combinations.

For social factor norm categories, the candidates can be greetings, requests, apologies, persuasion, criticism, and others. The resulting distribution of Scn statements from different data sources is depicted in Figure 1. Our analysis reveals a non-uniform distribution of social norm categories across all datasets, a trend consistent in each dataset. This indicates the varied impact of different norm categories in daily life. Notably, the ‘others’ category significantly surpasses others, suggesting the existence of numerous norm categories not encompassed by the predefined five categories. Additionally, the ‘request’ and ‘persuasion’ categories exhibit moderate frequencies, implying these social norms are more prevalent in
everyday interactions.

Among the various social factors analyzed, it is observed that
‘Formal’ is significantly more prevalent than ‘Informal’ in ‘Formality’. In ‘Social Distance’, the ‘Working’ relationship is the most common. As for ‘Social Relation’, the patterns of ‘Elder-Junior’, ‘Chief-Subordinate’, and ‘Mentor-Mentee’ relationships are predominant, all indicative of superior-subordinate dynamics. The most frequent ‘Location’ for these interactions is the ‘Office’, and the common ‘Topic’ revolves around ‘Office Affairs’. This analysis suggests that for the SocialDial dataset, a significant portion of social norms pertains to interactions between superiors and subordinates within formal work environments


# Case Study
Figure 2 presents some sample Scn statements generated from
real dialogues under three different conditions: with Gold Frames,
with Silver Frames, and without Frames. Firstly, in the first sub-
table with Gold Frames, the Scn statements encapsulate the “chief-
subordinate" relationship within the context of “office affairs". Simi-
larly, in the second sub-table with Silver Frames, the Scn statements
encompass the “student-professor" dynamic in “school life". How-
ever, in the third sub-table, where dialogues are presented without
frames, all the Scn statements revolve solely around conducting
reports. This approach overlooks the broader context of the real
dialogues, resulting in a lack of relevance and depth in the extracted
Scn statements. These observations underscore the value of incor-
porating frames in Scn statements extraction. By doing so, we can
effectively infuse domain knowledge into the process, transcending
the limitations of relying solely on the dialogue content.
